Administrative Playbook
Team Leader Checklist (before competition):
Get the team together, make sure all roles are assigned 
Linux/Windows administrative teams are aware of their playbooks and have read them over before competition.
Any documentation officers should be assigned to taking notes on any important information from hardening stages in the first hour (password policies, ports that were open then closed, firewalls setup, take notes of auditing stages and logs)
Documentation/Floaters should also keep track of lockouts and help with monitoring as well to be an extra set of eyes
Team Leader Checklist (during competition):

Make sure each team is following the time constraints and try not to spend too much time on one section.

Each team has their individual playbooks marked on different tabs and teams consist as follows:

Linux PB Rivers, Danny
Windows PB: Mason, Alana, Jordan
Palo Alto + Splunk PB: Connor, Joe
Documentation: Kara
